## Introduction
- Designed and developed a comprehensive Sales Dashboard to provide a real-time view of sales performance and key metrics. Leveraging the data visualization tool Power BI, I transformed raw sales data into interactive and insightful visualizations.
- The data was loaded from an SQL endpoint after extensive exploration, the data was Extracted Transformed, and Loaded ETL using Power Query.
- From top-level sales performance overview to granular product analysis and regional trends, the dashboard provides a real-time view of critical metrics, empowering stakeholders to make informed data-driven decisions. Its user-friendly interface facilitates easy exploration of data, while the interactive features enable users to delve deeper into specific areas of interest.
- The Sales Dashboard was further empowered by integrating advanced analytics techniques like CUSTOMER BASKET ANALYSIS, Store Basket Analysis, etc.
- With this comprehensive Sales Dashboard, teams can monitor trends, identify opportunities, and optimize strategies, ultimately driving efficiency and propelling growth across the organization.
